	 <h1>About</h1> 
   <p>I am a political scientist working on individual behaviour in mass member organisations. My research interests cover the implications of greater societal trends, such as the dissolution of traditional milieus on individuals’ political attitudes and behavior. I am interested in the interplay between societal dynamics and individuals, especially in how to measure and analyse it based on both qualitative and quantitative data.</p>
   <p>I am a <a href="http://hochschule-rhein-waal.de">postdoctoral researcher at Rhine-Waal University of Applied Sciences</a>, where I am coordinating the project <a href="http://eufoot.de">“The Identity Effect of Europeanized Lifeworlds: Becoming European via Football“</a>, funded by the German Research Foundation. Previously I worked as senior advisor to the Hans Böckler Foundation, as lecturer at the Institute of Political Science at the University of Duisburg-Essen and in several research projects for political parties and labour unions.</p>
<p>I also work as a freelance trainer and advisor in the area of counseling and career development. I am trained in diversity oriented career coaching, peer coaching and in solution focused counseling, all with a special focus on students and young researchers. In addition to that, I am trained as a skiing instructor.</p>

<h1>About</h1>
<p>I am a political scientist, heading the working area "transformation of industry, energy- and climate politics" at the <a href="https://www.arbeit-umwelt.de">Stiftung Arbeit und Umwelt</a>, the sustainability think tank of the German Mining, Chemical and Energy Labour Federation. I am fighting for a just and sustainable transformation, towards a ghg neutral economy.</p> 

My previous work includes positions as scientist at the <a href="https://www.dzsf.bund.de">German Centre for Rail Traffic Research (DZSF)</a>, as senior advisor at the <a href="http://www.boeckler.de">Hans BÃ¶ckler Foundation</a> and as researcher and adjunct lecturer at both the<a href="http://www.uni-due.de/politik">University of Duisburg-Essen</a> and <a href="https://www.hsrw.org">Rhine-Waal University</a> in Cleve. I am also trained in diversity oriented career coaching, peer coaching and in solution-focused counseling.</p>

<p>From 2018-2021 I was a postdoctoral researcher and project manager for the <a href="http://gepris.dfg.de/gepris/projekt/386268084">DFG</a> research project <a href="https://eufoot.github.io">The Identity Effect of Europeanized Lifeworlds</a> at <a href="https://www.hsrw.org">Rhine-Waal University</a> and <a href="https://www.uni-mainz.de">University of Mainz</a>. I initiated the follow-up project <a href="https://fanzine-research.github.io">FANZinE - Football as basis for social cohesion in Europe</a>, which I have later supported as scientific advisor.

<p>I have studied political science and history at the universities of Aachen, Prague and Potsdam. I obtained my PhD with a work on <a href="https://duepublico2.uni-due.de/servlets/MCRFileNodeServlet/duepublico_derivate_00043836/WeberRegina_Diss.pdf" target=_blank>Young people in old politics</a> from the Faculty of Social Sciences at the University of Duisburg-Essen (supervised by <a href="http://achimgoerres.de">Prof. Dr Achim Goerres</a>).</p>

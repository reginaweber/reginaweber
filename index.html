      <section>
        <p>I am a postdoctoral researcher at Rhine-Waal University of Applied Sciences, where I coordinate the project “The Identity Effect of Europeanized Lifeworlds: Becoming European via Football“, sponsored by the German Research Foundation.</p>
<p>My previous work include positions as senior advisor to the Hans Böckler Foundation, as lecturer at the University of Duisburg-Essen  and RWTH Aachen University and as independent researcher. I am also a freelance trainer and advisor in the area of student counseling and career development. I am trained in diversity oriented career coaching, peer coaching and in solution focused counseling with a special focus on students and young researchers. In addition to that, I am trained as a skiing instructor.</p>
<p>I studied politics and history at the universities of Aachen, Prague and Potsdam between 2003 and 2010. In 2017, I obtained my PhD with a work on “Young people in old politics” from the Faculty of Social Sciences at the University of Duisburg-Essen (supervised by Prof. Dr. Achim Goerres). During my PhD, I was a visiting fellow at the University of Oslo and the Institute for Social Research in Oslo.</p>

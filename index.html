<h1>About</h1>
<p>I am a political scientist at the <a href="https://www.dzsf.bund.de">German Rail Traffic Research Centre</a> (DZSF) where I work on research related to politics of transportation and mobility. I am also an adjunct lecturer at <a href="http://www.uni-due.de">University of Duisburg-Essen</a> and <a href="https://www.hsrw.org">Rhine-Waal University</a></p>

<p>From 2018-2021 I was a postdoctoral researcher and project manager of the <a href="http://gepris.dfg.de/gepris/projekt/386268084">GRF sponsored</a> research project <a href="https://eufoot.github.io">The Identity Effect of Europeanized Lifeworlds: Becoming European via Football</a> at <a href="https://www.hsrw.org">Rhine-Waal University</a> and <a href="https://www.uni-mainz.de">University of Mainz</a>. My previous work includes positions as senior advisor to the <a href="http://www.boeckler.de">Hans BÃ¶ckler Foundation</a>, as researcher at <a href="http://www.uni-due.de">University of Duisburg-Essen</a> and as lecturer at <a href="http://www.rwth.de">RWTH Aachen University</a>. I regularly teach methodology in social sciences and classes in the area of political participation, political organisations, and policy research. I am trained in diversity oriented career coaching, peer coaching and in solution-focused counseling with a special focus on students and young researchers.</p>

<p>I have studied mathematics (2001-2003) as well as political science and history (2003-2010) at the universities of Aachen, Prague and Potsdam. In 2017, I obtained my PhD with a work on <a href="https://duepublico2.uni-due.de/servlets/MCRFileNodeServlet/duepublico_derivate_00043836/WeberRegina_Diss.pdf">Young people in old politics</a>from the Faculty of Social Sciences at the University of Duisburg-Essen (supervised by <a href="http://achimgoerres.de">Prof. Dr Achim Goerres</a>). I was a visiting PhD fellow at the <a href="http://www.uio.no">University of Oslo</a> and the <a href="http://http:/samfunnsforskning.no/">Institute for Social Research in Oslo</a>.</p>

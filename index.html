        <p>I am a political scientist working on individual behaviour in mass member organisations. My research interests cover the implications of greater societal trends, such as the dissolution of traditional milieus on individualsâ€™ political attitudes and behavior. I am interested in the interplay between societal dynamics and individuals, and especially in how to measure and analyse it based on rich qualitative and quantitative data.</p> <br/> <br/>

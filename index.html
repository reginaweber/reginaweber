<h1>About</h1>
<p>I am a political scientist at the <a href="https://www.dzsf.bund.de">German Centre for Rail Traffic Research (DZSF)</a> in Bonn. I work as  researcher and political consultant in the field of transformation and public policy, particularly on projects related to public transport. I am also coordinating the centre's activities in science communication.</p> 

Previous work includes positions as senior advisor to the <a href="http://www.boeckler.de">Hans BÃ¶ckler Foundation</a>, as researcher and adjunct lecturer at <a href="http://www.uni-due.de/politik">University of Duisburg-Essen</a> and <a href="https://www.hsrw.org">Rhine-Waal University</a>, as well as lecturer at <a href="http://www.rwth.de">RWTH Aachen University</a>. I regularly teach classes in the area of political participation, political organisations, and policy research. I am trained in diversity oriented career coaching, peer coaching and in solution-focused counseling.</p>

<p>From 2018-2021 I was a postdoctoral researcher and project manager in the <a href="http://gepris.dfg.de/gepris/projekt/386268084">DFG</a> research project <a href="https://eufoot.github.io">The Identity Effect of Europeanized Lifeworlds: Becoming European via Football</a> at <a href="https://www.hsrw.org">Rhine-Waal University</a> and <a href="https://www.uni-mainz.de">University of Mainz</a>. I initiated the follow-up project <a href="https://fanzine-research.github.io">FANZinE - Football as basis for social cohesion in Europe</a>, which I am now supporting as scientific advisor.

<p>I have studied political science and history (2003-2010) at the universities of Aachen, Prague and Potsdam. In 2017, I obtained my PhD with a work on <a href="https://duepublico2.uni-due.de/servlets/MCRFileNodeServlet/duepublico_derivate_00043836/WeberRegina_Diss.pdf" target=_blank>Young people in old politics</a> from the Faculty of Social Sciences at the University of Duisburg-Essen (supervised by <a href="http://achimgoerres.de">Prof. Dr Achim Goerres</a>).</p>

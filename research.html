<h1>Research interest</h1>

<p>My main research interest covers identifications, attitudes and behaviour in the context of European integration. Broadly summarised, I study how the meta-trend of Europeanisation of everyday life influences people on the individual level. I cover everyday behaviour (such as work and leisure mobility), political participation in parties and trade unions as well as unconventional forms of political action, i.e. local protests or football fan organisations. I am also interested in political and business organisations to understand how they respond to the subjective Europeanisation among their members and in the public. I am furthermore interested in the development of political science methodology, covering qualitative and quantitative approaches.</p>

<p>During my Postdoc (2018-2021), I managed the GRF-sponsored research project <a href="https://www.eufoot.github.io">The identity effect of Europeanised lifeworlds: Becoming European through football? (EUFoot)</a>. The project aimed to understand how the accelerating Europeanisation of competitions and governance structures in football left an imprint on identifications and activities of football fans. It analysed a mainstream leisure activity – football – and its relevance for the formation of a European identity. I follow up on these activities as scientific advisor to the follow-up project <a href="https://fanzine-research.github.io">FANZinE - football as basis for social cohesion in Europe</a>.</p>

<p>My <a href="http://duepublico.uni-duisburg-essen.de/servlets/DerivateServlet/Derivate-43836/WeberRegina_Diss.pdf">PhD project (2012-2017)</a> at the Institute for Political Science (University of Duisburg-Essen, Prof. Dr. Achim Goerres) focused the motives and activities of young party members in the context of greater societal trends and organisational changes within political parties. The empirical case of my thesis was the German social democratic party (SPD). The study used a mixed method design with semi-structures interviews and a total population survey among the young members in this party.</p>

<p>Past research projects and activities covered the development of political organisations such as student self-government organisations and party youth organisations, as well as trade unions with a regional/country focus on Germany, Austria, the United Kingdom, Israel and Palestine. Additionally, I was involved in several projects in the area of higher education research, student orientation and individual career development of students, predominantly from marginalised groups (see <a href="https://reginaweber.github.io/publication.html">Publication</a>).</p>

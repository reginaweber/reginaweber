<h1>Research interest</h1>

<p>My main research interest is individual political behaviour and political organisations. Broadly summarised, I study how the meta-trend of Europeanisation of everyday life influences political attitudes and behaviour on the individual level and how it changes political organisations. I understand political behaviour in a broad sense, covering traditional participation such as party membership and unconventional forms of action, i.e. protests, or football fandom organisations. I am furthermore interested in political science methodology, covering qualitative and quantitative approaches, as well as mixed methods.></p>

<p>As a Postdoc, I coordinated the GRF-sponsored research project <a href="https://www.eufoot.github.io">The identity effect of Europeanised lifeworlds: Becoming European through football? (EUFoot)</a>. The project aimed to understand how the accelerating Europeanisation of competitions and governance structures in football left an imprint on identifications and activities of football fans. It analysed a mainstream leisure activity – football – and its relevance for the formation of a European identity.</p>

<p>My <a href="http://duepublico.uni-duisburg-essen.de/servlets/DerivateServlet/Derivate-43836/WeberRegina_Diss.pdf">PhD project (2012-2017)</a> at the Institute for Political Science (University of Duisburg-Essen, Prof. Dr. Achim Goerres) focused the motives and activities of young party members in the context of greater societal trends and organisational changes within political parties. The empirical case of my thesis was the German social democratic party (SPD). The study used a mixed method design with semi-structures interviews and a total population survey among the young members in this party.</p>

<p>Past research projects and activities covered the development of political organisations such as student self-government organisations and party youth organisations, as well as trade unions. Additionally, I was involved in several projects in the area of higher education research, student orientation and individual career development of students, predominantly from marginalised groups (see <a href="https://reginaweber.github.io/publication.html">Publication</a>).</p>

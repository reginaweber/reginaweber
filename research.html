<h2>Research interest</h2>

<p>I research how socio-economic change influences political attitudes, political behaviour and the organisation of politics in democratic societies. My main area of interest is political mobilisation. I am further interested in political science methodology, especially qualitative and quantitative methods in comparative research. I seek the benefits of different research strategies to analyse societies that are becoming more complex and more unified at the same time. I like the increased availability of data and programming opportunities. I use R extensively and support the idea of open source software for academic use.</p>

<p>My <a href="http://duepublico.uni-duisburg-essen.de/servlets/DerivateServlet/Derivate-43836/WeberRegina_Diss.pdf">PhD project (2012-2017)</a> at the Institute for Political Science (University of Duisburg-Essen, Prof. Dr. Achim Goerres) focused the motives and activities of young party members in the context of greater societal trends and organisational changes within political parties. The empirical case of my thesis was the German social democratic party (SPD). The study used a mixed method design with semi-structures interviews and a total population survey among the young members in this party.</p>

<p>Other past research projects covered the development of political organisations such as student self-government organisations and party youth organisations. Additionally, I was involved in several projects in the area of higher education research, student orientation and individual career development of students, predominantly from marginalised groups (see <a href="https://reginaweber.github.io/publication.html">Publication</a>).</p>

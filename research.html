<h1>Research interests</h1>


<h4>Just transition and transformation politics</h4>

<p>The concurrent mega trends <strong>green transformation, geopolitics, digitization</strong> and <strong>demographics</strong> disrupt all our daily lives: The way we work, travel, eat, or consume change rapidly, whether we want it or not. While for some, this is an opportunity for societal improvement, many people feel threatened by the ruptures and become alienated from political institutions and practices. I am thrilled by the question which strategies can be developed for a socially inclusive and just green transformation.</p>

<h4>Social identity and political behaviour</h4>

<p>My research interest origins are in the field of social identifications and their implication for political behaviour. In the past decade, I have been studying student and trade union activism, (social democratic) party membership, football fandom, citizen participation in public infrastructures and mobility behaviour. The recurring theme in these works is the question of how <strong>self-understandings interplay with political behaviour</strong>: How does identity shape political behaviour in post-modern societies? And how does political behaviour play back on self-identifications? As a political scientist, I follow these questions with the aim to understand how these individual level mechanisms influence the political institutions and organisations.</p>

<h4>The context: Europe</h4>

<p>My regional focus has been in the European countries. I take the European integration as background of my work. Broadly summarised, the meta-trend of Europeanisation of everyday life and the successive reduction of manifest borders within Europe (though only for European/Western citizens) is the bakdrop against all my work. I am keen to find out how democratic societies across Europe deal with the pitfalls of change and transformation.</p>

<h4>Projects and positions</h4>

<p>I am currently head of the division "Transformation of Industries" at <a href="http://www.arbeit-umwelt.de">Stiftung Arbeit und Umwelt</a> of the IGBCE industrial union. We provide science-based support for the transformation of energy-intensive industries, particularly in the chemical, energy and mining sectors, with a clear focus on employment. My work specialises on the supply of raw materials, cohesion policy and the future development of our industries.</p>

<p>My past position at the <a href="https://www.dzsf.bund.de">German Centre for Rail Traffic Research</a>  covered applied research on mobility behaviour and transformation of the mobility sector. The institute is a research facility of the German Federal Government. Projects included i.e. citizen participation in rail infrastructure projects or the interplay between public transport access and local identity.</p>

<p>During my Postdoc (2018-2021), I managed the GRF-sponsored research project <a href="https://www.eufoot.github.io">The identity effect of Europeanised lifeworlds: Becoming European through football? (EUFoot)</a>. The project aimed to understand how the accelerating Europeanisation of competitions and governance structures in football left an imprint on identifications and activities of football fans. It analysed a mainstream leisure activity – football – and its relevance for the formation of a European identity. I follow up on these activities as scientific advisor to the follow-up project <a href="https://fanzine-research.github.io">FANZinE - football as basis for social cohesion in Europe</a>.</p>

<p>My <a href="http://duepublico.uni-duisburg-essen.de/servlets/DerivateServlet/Derivate-43836/WeberRegina_Diss.pdf">PhD project (2012-2017)</a> at the Institute for Political Science (University of Duisburg-Essen, Prof. Dr. Achim Goerres) focused the motives and activities of young party members in the context of greater societal trends and organisational changes within political parties. The empirical case of my thesis was the German social democratic party (SPD). The study used a mixed method design with semi-structures interviews and a total population survey among the young members in this party.</p>

<p>Past research projects and activities covered the development of political organisations such as student self-government organisations and party youth organisations, as well as trade unions with a regional/country focus on Germany, Austria, the United Kingdom, Israel and Palestine. Additionally, I was involved in several projects in the area of higher education research, student orientation and individual career development of students, predominantly from marginalised groups (see <a href="https://reginaweber.github.io/publication.html">Publication</a>).</p>

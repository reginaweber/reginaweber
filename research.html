<h2>Research interest</h2>

<p>I research how larger societal changes influence political attitudes, behaviour and the organisation of politics in democracies. My main interest is political mobilisation. I am also interested in political science methodology, using both qualitative and quantitative approaches. I enjoy the increasing availability of large and big data. I use R extensively and encourage open source software for research and teaching purpose.</p>

<p>I am currently coordinating the GRF-sponsored research project <a href="https://www.eufoot.de">The identity effect of Europeanised lifeworlds: Becoming European through football? (EUFoot)</a>. The aim of the project is to understand how the ongoing and accelerating Europeanisation of competitions and governance structures in football has left an imprint on the identifications of football fans. It analyses a mainstream lifeworld leisure activity -- football -- and its relevance for the formation of a European identity.

<p>My <a href="http://duepublico.uni-duisburg-essen.de/servlets/DerivateServlet/Derivate-43836/WeberRegina_Diss.pdf">PhD project (2012-2017)</a> at the Institute for Political Science (University of Duisburg-Essen, Prof. Dr. Achim Goerres) focused the motives and activities of young party members in the context of greater societal trends and organisational changes within political parties. The empirical case of my thesis was the German social democratic party (SPD). The study used a mixed method design with semi-structures interviews and a total population survey among the young members in this party.</p>

<p>Other past research projects covered the development of political organisations such as student self-government organisations and party youth organisations. Additionally, I was involved in several projects in the area of higher education research, student orientation and individual career development of students, predominantly from marginalised groups (see <a href="https://reginaweber.github.io/publication.html">Publication</a>).</p>

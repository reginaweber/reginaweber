<h1>Research interest</h1>

<p>My main research interest is how organisational change (i.e., of political parties or trade unions) and the meta-trend of Europeanisation of everyday life influence political attitudes and behaviour on the individual level across European societies. I understand political behaviour in a broad sense, covering both traditional participation such as party membership and unconventional forms of action, i.e. protests, football fan organisations or online activities. I am furthermore interested in political science methodology, covering both qualitative and quantitative approaches, as well as mixed methods. I use R extensively and encourage open source software in research and teaching.</p>

<p>I am currently coordinating the GRF-sponsored research project <a href="https://www.eufoot.de">The identity effect of Europeanised lifeworlds: Becoming European through football? (EUFoot)</a>. The aim of the project is to understand how the ongoing and accelerating Europeanisation of competitions and governance structures in football has left an imprint on the identifications of football fans. It analyses a mainstream lifeworld leisure activity -- football -- and its relevance for the formation of a European identity.

<p>My <a href="http://duepublico.uni-duisburg-essen.de/servlets/DerivateServlet/Derivate-43836/WeberRegina_Diss.pdf">PhD project (2012-2017)</a> at the Institute for Political Science (University of Duisburg-Essen, Prof. Dr. Achim Goerres) focused the motives and activities of young party members in the context of greater societal trends and organisational changes within political parties. The empirical case of my thesis was the German social democratic party (SPD). The study used a mixed method design with semi-structures interviews and a total population survey among the young members in this party.</p>

<p>Past research projects and activities covered the development of political organisations such as student self-government organisations and party youth organisations, as well as trade unions. Additionally, I was involved in several projects in the area of higher education research, student orientation and individual career development of students, predominantly from marginalised groups (see <a href="https://reginaweber.github.io/publication.html">Publication</a>).</p>
